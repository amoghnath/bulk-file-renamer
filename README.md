# Bulk File Renamer
Simple Bulk File Renamer written in python with a minimal Command-Line Interface

I chose this simple project as this is my first full-fledged python script, I will be adding more features in the future such as RegEx, Album/Track/Songs, and selecting 
specific files in the folder.

I will also be implementing a Qt based UI for this script. Any inputs and improvements will be appreciated :)
